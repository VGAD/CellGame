HOW TO PLAY
-----------
Run CANCERKILLER.exe.

Both players control a growing cancerous tumour. The players are represented by a white cursor (Cancer) and a black cursor (Anti-Cancer).

The Cancer player's goal is to take over the body by guiding the tumour to eat 30 pieces of food (green blocks). Their cursor attracts cancer
cells, causing the tumour to mutate toward it. They use the W/A/S/D keys to move their cursor.

The Anti-Cancer player's goal is to make all the cells in the tumor die off. Their cursor repels cancer cells, causing the tumour to mutate away from the
black ball. They use the arrow keys to move their cursor.

Normally, cancer cells are red. While red, cancer cells will very slowly deplete, causing the tumour to shrink. When red cancer cells come in 
contact with food, they will multiply and produce more cells around the food.

If a group of cancer cells gets cut off from the Cancer player's blob, they will become black. While black, cells die off very quickly and are
not able to absorb food. If the group is reattached, they will become red again.

If 30 pieces of food are eaten, the Cancer player wins. If the number of red cancer cells drops too low (specifically, below 200, not that you can tell),
the Anti-Cancer player wins.

Press R to restart the game.


DEBUG
-----
If you want to play around with the game's debug settings, use these keys:
[ - change cell consistency (changes rules for cell reproduction)
] - spawn a vortex (not used in game normally)
\ - spawn food
p - grow the player's blob
; - shrink the player's blob

BUILDING
--------
Go to Project Properties -> Configuration Properties -> Debugging and set Working Directory to $(SolutionDir)/Run.
Set the environment variable ECSE_DIR to your ECSE install.
Note that ECSE, Boost and SFML must be compiled with the preprocessor definition _ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL=0 in order to
build in Debug mode. Release should build without it, however.
